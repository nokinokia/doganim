        <h2>
            In a nostalgic corner of the Solana blockchain, there lived a puppy named DOGANIM. DOGANIM was an old-school 90s
            puppy, a true relic of the era with his laid-back attitude and love for all things retro. His fur was a
            patchwork of colors, reminiscent of the vibrant patterns found on vintage windbreakers, and he had a collar
            adorned with a tiny, jingling Tamagotchi.
        </h2>
        <img src="images/V2.jpg" />
        <h2>
            DOGANIM days were filled with adventures that brought back the essence of the 90s. Each morning, he’d stroll
            out of his house, his ears perking up to the sound of classic rock tunes playing from a nearby boombox. He’d
            greet the neighborhood kids, who always marveled at his cool demeanor and retro charm.
        </h2>
        <img src="images/V3.jpg" />
        <h2>
            One of DOGANIM favorite hangouts was the local arcade. The flashing lights and electronic sounds made him
            feel right at home. He would weave through the legs of gamers, watching with keen interest as they played
            Pac-Man and Street Fighter. Sometimes, the arcade owner would let DOGANIM sit on the counter, where he’d bat at
            the joysticks and buttons, much to everyone’s amusement.
        </h2>
        <img src="images/V4.jpg" />
        <h2>
            DOGANIM also had a secret lair in the basement of his owner’s house—a room decked out with posters of 90s
            icons, lava lamps, and a collection of VHS tapes. He’d spend hours lounging on a beanbag chair, watching
            reruns of classic cartoons and old-school wrestling matches.
